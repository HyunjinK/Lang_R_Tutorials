This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
data("GNI2014")
head(GNI2014)
```

```{r}
GNI2014%>%filter(continent=="Asia")->Asia
head(Asia, 10)
```

```{r, fig1, fig.height=3, fig.width=5}
ggplot(Asia, aes(area = GNI, fill = population, label = country)) +
  geom_treemap() + geom_treemap_text(fontface = "italic", colour = "white", place = "centre", grow = TRUE) + theme(legend.position = "bottom") + labs(title = "The Gross National Income per capital 2014")
```

```{r}
ggplot(GNI2014, aes(x = population, y = GNI, size = population, col = continent, alpha = GNI)) + geom_point()
```
